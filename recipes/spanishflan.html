    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious Spanish flan — it's easy to make and everyone will love it!</p>
    <p>"Flan" can refer to a couple different things depending on where you live. In this case, it's a baked custard dessert topped with caramel. The Spanish dessert is similar to the French crème caramel.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 whole eggs</li>
            <li>1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid oz) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour hot syrup into a 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom and sides; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture into the baking dish; cover with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Let cool completely.</li>
            <li>To serve, carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate; let caramel sauce flow over flan.</li>
        </ol>
